title: "Kotlin Onboarding: Object-Oriented programming"
language: English
summary: " <p>This course is designed for novices in Kotlin and focuses on the object-oriented\
  \ (OOP) concepts of the Kotlin language. This is the second module of the course,\
  \ the first module can be found on JetBrains <a href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21067-kotlin-onboarding--introduction\"\
  >Marketplace</a>. This module assumes that you are familiar with all the constructs\
  \ discussed in the first part.</p>\n<p>Each lesson of the course is built in the\
  \ form of a web project: step by step, by completing different small tasks, you\
  \ will get a functional project in the end. At the end of each lesson, an additional\
  \ similar project will be offered: it includes all the topics of the lesson but\
  \ does not contain the theory part.</p>\n<p><i>Note, this course does not provide\
  \ a detailed explanation of the OOP concepts, it just shows how to use them in Kotlin\
  \ and can briefly remind you the definitions.</i></p>\n<p>All topics will be accompanied\
  \ by links to <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html\">the official Kotlin\
  \ documentation</a>, which you can read later. Some of the topics covered in the\
  \ course are listed below:</p> <ul> <li>packages;</li> <li>classes, properties,\
  \ and member functions;</li> <li>type aliases;</li> <li>value and data classes;</li>\
  \ <li>companion objects;</li> <li>extension functions;</li> <li>objects;</li> <li>initializer\
  \ blocks;</li> <li>enum classes;</li> <li>functional interfaces (Single Abstract\
  \ Method, SAM);</li> <li>interfaces and inheritance;</li> <li>some built-in functions\
  \ to handle errors and work with collections.</li> </ul>\n<p><i>After this course,\
  \ you will be ready to write basic Kotlin applications.</i></p>\n<p><b>Before starting\
